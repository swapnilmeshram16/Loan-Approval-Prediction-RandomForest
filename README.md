# Loan-Approval-Prediction-RandomForest
This machine learning project predicts whether a loan will be approved based on user inputs using a Random Forest Classifier. It performs data preprocessing, label encoding, scaling, model training, and user input prediction.

## üîç Features

- Predicts loan approval status (Approved/Rejected)
- Takes 15-step user input from real-time user
- Uses Label Encoding + Standard Scaler
- Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: ~77%
- Easily extendable with other ML models like XGBoost, CatBoost
